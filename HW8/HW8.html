<h1>Homework 8 </h1>
<h2>Victoria VanAuken</h2>
<h3>These three maps use the ratio of adults 18 to 19 in Ohio enrolled in school divided by the overall populations of the counties. I would have liked to use the population of adults 18 to 19. However, the county population data only had ages 15-19 as a category. The ratio is intended to try to show the percentage of young adults starting college per county (as 18-19 is often the age one starts college). However, the variability in the proportion of each county population that is in the desired age category will likely different.</h3>
