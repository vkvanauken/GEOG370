<h1>Homework 10-Geoprocessing </h1>
<h2>Victoria VanAuken</h2>
<h3>The question that I decided to answer graphically is which historic landmarks in Raleigh are at the highest risk of flooding and thus damage. In order to assess this, I used a historic landmarks shapefile as well as a special hazard floodplains shapefile from the Wake County GIS site. I decided to create a buffer of 100 feet around the national register of historic places file as I figured that it would give the landmarks the least chance of damage in an extreme weather event. Then, I created an intersection of the FEMA hazardous floodplain and the buffer, shown in green, which  are the areas most at risk of flood damage.</h3>
